## About The Project

This project was created to serve as a digital resume and a central hub for my professional profile. It's a single-page application built with core web technologies, demonstrating my abilities in front-end development and UI design. The goal was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

### Key Features:

-   **Responsive Design:** Looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
-   **Dark UI:** Modern dark theme with neon blue accents and glowing effects.
-   **Dynamic Animations:** Smooth, animated scrolling and element reveals powered by the ScrollReveal.js library.
-   **Interactive Modals:** Detailed information for each service opens in a clean pop-up window.
-   **Live Typing Effect:** An engaging "typing" animation in the hero section using Typed.js.
-   **Skills Showcase:** Animated progress bars for both technical and professional skills.
-   **Contact Form:** A functional and styled contact section.
